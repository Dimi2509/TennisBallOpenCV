# Autonomous tennis ball pickup robot
This is a fourth semester project for mechatronics students where an autonomous vehicle had to be developed.

The robot consists of a raspberry pi 3 B+ where opencv runs an object detection model to detect tennis balls and an arduino uno connected through serial communication, where motors and flywheels are controlled.

# Our team won the TEK Expo for having the best third semester project.
